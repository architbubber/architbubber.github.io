<p id="set1" >Drone Build</p>

<p id="para">This borrows its design from the Dji F450 and was made just for learning about flight controller and handing data from mpu6050 gyro module.This project was equally challenging and interesting to make.You don't just require to code and assemble but require :
1.Handle PID values.
2.Learn to process input and give output to motors accordingly.
3.Even i didn't realise this earlier that it just looks easy to fly but some training on simulator beforehand is actually required.
Consisting of four 2200kv bloc motors with 30 amp Simonk esc and a 3S 2200maH battery pack ,it was estimated to get a flight time of around 10-11 mins which came out to be quiet a good estimate.
Flight Controller:
Since all my projects are scratch made the flight controller too had to be.Therefore I decided to make the flight controller using arduino itself.After scratching the net i found out about Multiwii which was open sourced and originally made for arduino only .Since it also gave me a gui I thought its better to save time and use some colors instead of every time looking at that moncoloured Serial Monitor for values.</p>

After assembling all the parts and adding the multiwii code to arduino nano and giving input from the custom made ppm signal capable nrf transmitter, it was finally time to fly.Before flight i tested everything was working on multiwii gui and then adjusted whatever was needed and Voila!!!
THE DRONE FLEW...
